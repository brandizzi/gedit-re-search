== Features ==

There are a lot of Gedit regular expressions plugins out there, including some old versions of this one. So, what are the advantages of Gedit RE Search? Well, it is a subjective choice but below we list some interesting aspects of this plugin.

=== Appearance of the default Replace dialog ===

The appearance of this plugin is closer to the default Replace dialog from plugin. Well, at least //we// think it is a good thing :) It makes the plugin simple and familiar for most Gedit users.

=== Highlight of found patterns ===

Gedit RE Search highlights the found strings. It is not updated "on-line" like the default search highlight but it is very helpful.

=== Search and replace history of the current Gedit session ===

This plugin stores the last search and replace inputs, easing the process of reusing searches.

=== Keyboard shortcut / Accel keys ===
One can open Gedit RE Search dialog pressing **Control+R** / **Command+R** (on Mac OS).

=== Does not use Glade ===
The plugins which were used as base for this one used Python [[http://www.jamesh.id.au/software/libglade/|libglade]], which were slower and a bit disproportional. This version does not use libglade anymore.

=== Supports Gedit 3 ===

Since version 20120508v3, you can use Gedit RE Search on Gedit 3. Since version 20131023v3.8, it works on Gedit 3.8, too, thanks for our contributor Albert Schubert.
